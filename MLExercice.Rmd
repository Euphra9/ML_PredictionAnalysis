To achieve the project objective of predicting the manner in which individuals exercised using the provided training and test datasets, i followed a systematic approach that included data preparation, model building, cross-validation, and performance evaluation. Here is a detailed report on our methodology and findings.

# 1. Download Packages

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
if (!requireNamespace("caret", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("caret")
}
if (!requireNamespace("randomForest", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("randomForest")
}

# Load libraries
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
```

# 2. Data Preparation

### 2.A. Loading the Data

I started by loading the training and test datasets:

```{r}
# Load the datasets
train_data <- read.csv('pml-training.csv', na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
test_data <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv', na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
```

### 2.B. Data Cleaning

I removed columns with many missing values and those deemed irrelevant for the analysis (e.g., identifiers and dates):

```{r}
# Remove columns with many missing values
train_data <- train_data[, colSums(is.na(train_data)) == 0]
test_data <- test_data[, colSums(is.na(test_data)) == 0]


# Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., identifiers and dates)
cols_to_remove <- 1:7  # Index of columns to remove
train_data <- train_data[, -cols_to_remove]
test_data <- test_data[, -cols_to_remove]

```

I also removed columns with constant values as they provide no useful information for prediction:

```{r}
train_data <- train_data[, sapply(train_data, function(x) length(unique(x)) > 1)]
test_data <- test_data[, names(test_data) %in% names(train_data)]

```

### 2.C. Data Normalization

I normalized the data so that all features are on the same scale, which is often beneficial for machine learning algorithms

```{r}
preProc <- preProcess(train_data[, -ncol(train_data)], method = c("center", "scale"))
train_data[, -ncol(train_data)] <- predict(preProc, train_data[, -ncol(train_data)])
print(train_data)
```

```{r}
test_data <- predict(preProc, test_data)
print(test_data)
```

# 3. Model building

### 3.A.Data Splitting

I separated the training dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)

```{r}
X <- train_data[, -ncol(train_data)]
y <- train_data$classe
```

Then, i split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate our model's performance

```{r}
set.seed(42)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(y, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
trainSet <- train_data[trainIndex, ]
validationSet <- train_data[-trainIndex, ]


```

### 3.B. Model Training

I used a Random Forest model with grid search to find the best hyperparameters. I performed 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance

```{r}
# Register parallel backend
cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Hyperparameter tuning using random search
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, search = "random")

# Train the model using parallel processing
set.seed(42)
rf_model <- train(classe ~ ., data = trainSet, method = "rf", trControl = train_control, tuneLength = 10)

# Print the best model parameters
print(rf_model)


```

# 4. Model Evaluation

### 4.A. Cross-Validation Results

We displayed the cross-validation results to identify the best hyperparameters

```{r}
print(rf_model)

```

The Random Forest model exhibits exceptional performance in classifying the dataset, with an overall accuracy of 94.04%. During cross-validation, the model achieved its highest accuracy of 94.40% with an `mtry` value of 7. 

The Kappa score of 0.9245 indicates a strong agreement between predicted and actual values. 


### 4.B. Predictions and Confusion Matrix

We used the trained model to predict the validation set and calculated the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance

```{r}
# Predict on the validation set
predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = validationSet)

# Ensure validationSet$classe is a factor with levels
validationSet$classe <- factor(validationSet$classe, levels = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"))

# Create confusion matrix
confMatrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, validationSet$classe)

# Print confusion matrix
print(confMatrix)



```

The confusion matrix shows that the model performs exceptionally well, particularly for classes A and E, with high sensitivity and specificity. While classes B, C, and D exhibit minor misclassifications, the overall error rates are low. 

To further enhance the model, additional hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, or exploring alternative models could be considered. Overall, the Random Forest model demonstrates robust classification capabilities with excellent generalization to out-of-sample data.

### 4.C. Variable Importance

We visualized the importance of variables to understand which features were most influential in the model

```{r}
varImpPlot(cv_model$finalModel)

```

# 5. Predictions on the Test Set

Finally, we used the model to predict the outcomes of the 20 test cases:

```{r}
test_predictions <- predict(cv_model, newdata = test_data)
print(test_predictions)

```

# 6. Conclusion

The Random Forest model was built systematically, following a rigorous approach for data cleaning, feature selection, normalization, cross-validation, and performance evaluation. The confusion matrix demonstrated good accuracy, giving us confidence in the expected out-of-sample error of the model. The variable importance plot revealed the most critical features for predicting the target variable "classe".

In summary, the model is well-trained and ready to be used to predict the manner in which individuals exercised, with solid performance confirmed by cross-validation.
